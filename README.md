# cocktail App

# Author:Kirop Evans 

## Project Description 

Today I will be building an app for Cocktail. I will be
using a public API  from CocktaildB and building the front-end part for the app,using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which will communicate with a public API.

# SetUp Instruction
1. clone the repository(git clone (git url)
2. Make the appropriate changes in the files
3. Run the server to see all changes in the files
4. Add the changes and commit them regularly(git commit -m "made changes")
5. Push to the branch(git push -u origin main/master)



# How To Run The Project
Run this by  using (npm install) to install all the dependancies

Test the server by visiting this route in the browser:

([https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita])

Then, open the `index.html` file on the browser to run the application.

Write the code in the `src/index.js` file. The base URL for your API will be
([https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita]).

When you click on search button to search for cocktails from the app  it will give you the cocktail name,cocktail ingredients including the cocktail measure  and instructions of how to make the cocktail for the cocktail clients who want something good.
